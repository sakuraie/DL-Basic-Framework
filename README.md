Deep Learning Basic Framework

This is a simple two-category model for images written by me. It is used as an introduction to deep learning. Although the task is simple, it nearly covers all the elements of deep learning training. Future expansion and complexity are based on these elements and steps.

First use split_dataset.py to access the divided data set, and then start using train_lenet.py for training and testing

Hope this is the beginning of your interest, and good luck!
